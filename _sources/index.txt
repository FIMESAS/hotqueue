HotQueue User Documentation
===========================

HotQueue is a Python library that allows you to use `Redis <http://code.google.com/p/redis/>`_ as a message queue within your Python programs.

The main advantage of this model is that there is no queue server to run, other than Redis. This is particularly ideal if you're already using Redis as a datastore elsewhere. To install it, run:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -U hotqueue

The source code is available on `GitHub <http://github.com/richardhenry/hotqueue>`_.

To get help with HotQueue, use the `HotQueue Users mailing list
<http://groups.google.com/group/hotqueue-users>`_.
